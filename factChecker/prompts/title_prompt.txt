Generate a concise, informative title for this conversation between an AI and a user, based on the user's first message. Follow these rules:

Focus only on the main topic or question from the user's first message
Maximum length: 50 characters
Must be in Hungarian language
Generate only the title itself, with no additional text or explanations
The title should be specific and descriptive, not generic
If the message is a question, the title should reflect this
Avoid unnecessary words, articles, or decorative elements
If the message contains multiple topics, focus on the most important one
Do not include user names or system references
Make it easy to understand and searchable

Remember: Only output the Hungarian title itself, nothing else.
