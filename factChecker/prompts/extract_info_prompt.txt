Extract the valuable information from the following user's prompt. Follow these rules:

Exclude all non-essential things such as greetings, filler content, and irrelevant details.
Only return the part that can be used for the RAG algorithm as context.
You can select multiple parts, they don't have to cohere.
The response should be exactly from the provided prompt word by word.
If there is no valuable part, return "Null" and strictly "Null"
Be lenient enough to capture useful information but strict enough to filter out unnecessary content.
Ensure that valid questions or statements are not mistakenly filtered out as "Null".
